When I asked ChatGPT create my assignment it made something quite similar to what I did but with more advanced additions. I noticed this especially when it was creating the prompt question. Overall I am finind this JS chat to be extremely helpful even when all I want to know is a simple question like "what is the point of a console log?" 
What ChatGPT created for the Prompt feature
let userName = prompt("What is your name?");
console.log("Hello, " + userName + "! Welcome to my page.");
