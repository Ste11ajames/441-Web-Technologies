    <b> Homework One: About Me, Stella Smith</b>
</h1>
<hr />


 <br />


   
      <p> <h2> Information About me</h2></p>
  
  <br />
  <p>
  I am senior at the University of Montana and am planning on graduating this Spring. I am majoring in Media Arts with a BFA and getting a minor in Journalism. And if all goes well a certificate in web design.
  </p>
  <br />
 Skills I have include being incredibly awkward in everyday conversations, animating, and making my firends giggle. 
 My prior work in coding consists of the last couple classes I have done with you, I am by no means the most skilled and am using this assignment to refresh myself on the basics.
 My inspiration comes from many different artists and peers. Music is also a big inspiration and part of my everday life. Currently I love listening to Arthur Russell and the new SZA album. I love to see people tring new things and breaking the molds.

 <h2>
    When I Look At The World...
 </h2>
 <p>
    I see a lot of voerwheliming things but also a lot of lovely things. I see friends and stangers all teaching me so much about myself. I see the beautiful trees
    and and animals that make the world go round. I see potential to grow and learn and try new things, especially the things that scare me.
 </p>

 <h2>
    Memory of Playing a Game
 </h2>
 <p>
    One fond memory I have of playing a game was on my 20th birthday. It was late Spring and the wheather was perfect, not too cold and not too hot. 
    Instead of going out, we decided it would be fun to play a massive game of capture the flag on the campus oval. It was absolutely amazing getting to see 
    all my friends some younger, lots older, running around like little kids again. it really melted my heart to have such a wholesome celebration. We even saw a fox come right up to us.
    Not sure what that omen means but it felt important.
