When I asked ChatGOT to create the homework assignment it included a lot more things i hadn;t seen before or had included in my own work. While I'm sure something would have appeared if I had pluggled it into my computer and attatched its fake photos it wouldn't be as fun as making your own. I had more fun on this assignment thought I stuggled to make two side by side collums of four and ended up having one large collum of 8, this still works but when we continue the project I plan on fixing that.
