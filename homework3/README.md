When trying this out with ChatGPT it created a very weird but working story to follow. When creating my own I could not get my photos to work for the life of me and decided this was better than nothing. ChatGPT was helpful in aiding me with how to connect these things together as I'd be quite lost without it on this assignment, but for creating your story its definently not the most exciting.
