this one was bit confusing to me and I'm still a bit confused about what you mean by rotating words and quotes so i just have the quotes changeing every 4 seconds. I went with a sort of daily inspiration route. I wasn't sure how to get the shapes to go over the pictures so they ended up being bellow in the canvas. I definetly found the p5.js chat gpt quite helpful when i was running into issues with this one specifically moving shapes. There aren't many but there are some!
